### Repository for my Kaggle TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge code
This code is based on TensorFlow Simple Audio Recognition tutorial. In fact, the first commit is just a port of the tutorial code to run as a Jupyter notebook.

The model trained using the tutorial code produces a score of about .63. To improve the score and performance, I'm going to implement batch normalization and pseudo labeling.
